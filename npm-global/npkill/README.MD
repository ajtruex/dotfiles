This tool allows you to list any _node_modules_ directories in your system, as well as the space they take up. You can then select which ones you want to erase to free up space. Yay!

# :heavy_check_mark: Features

- **Clear space:** Get rid of old and dusty node_modules cluttering up your machine.

- **Very fast:** NPKILL is written in TypeScript, but searches are performed at a low level, improving performance greatly.

- **Easy to use:** Say goodbye to lengthy commands. Using npkill is as simple as reading a list of your node_modules, and pressing Del to get rid of them. Could it be any easier? ;)

- **Minified:** It barely has any dependencies.

<a name="installation"></a>

# :cloud: Installation

You don't really need to install it to use it!
Simply use the following command:

```bash
$ npx npkill
```

Or if for some reason you really want to install it:

```bash
$ npm i -g npkill
# Unix users may need to run the command with sudo. Go carefully
```

<a name="usage"></a>

# :clipboard: Usage

```bash
$ npx npkill
# or just npkill if installed globally
```

By default, npkill will scan for node_modules starting at the path where `npkill` command is executed.

Move between the listed folders with <kbd>↓</kbd> <kbd>↑</kbd>, and use <kbd>Space</kbd> to delete the selected folder.
You can also use <kbd>j</kbd> and <kbd>k</kbd> to move between the results

To exit, <kbd>Q</kbd> or <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>c</kbd> if you're brave.

**Warning:** _In future versions some commands may change_

<a name="examples"></a>

## Examples

- Search **node_modules** directories in your _projects_ directory:

```bash
npkill -d ~/projects

# other alternative:
cd ~/projects
npkill
```

- List directories named "dist" and show errors if any occur:

```bash
npkill --target dist -e
```

- Displays the magenta color cursor... because I like magenta!

```bash
npkill --color magenta
```

- List **vendor** directories in your _projects_ directory, sort by size, and show size in gb:

```bash
npkill -d '~/more projects' -gb --sort size --target vendor
```

- List **node_modules** in your _projects_ directory, excluding the ones in _progress_ and _ignore-this_ directories:

```bash
npkill -d 'projects' --exclude "progress, ignore-this"
```

- Automatically delete all node_modules that have sneaked into your backups:

```bash
# Disabled for security reasons (you can use it in version 0.2.4 at your risk)
npkill -d ~/backups/ --delete-all
```

<a name="setup-locally"></a>

# :pager: Set Up Locally

```bash
# -- First, clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/voidcosmos/npkill.git

# -- Navigate to the dir
cd npkill

# -- Install dependencies
npm install

# -- And run!
npm run start


# -- If you want to run it with some parameter, you will have to add "--" as in the following example:
npm run start -- -f -e
```

<a name="roadmap"></a>

# :crystal_ball: Roadmap

- [x] Release 0.1.0 !
- [x] Improve code
  - [x] Improve performance
  - [ ] Improve performance even more!
- [x] Sort results by size and path
- [x] Allow the search for other types of directories (targets)
- [ ] Reduce dependencies to be a more minimalist module
- [ ] Allow to filter by directories that have not been used in a period of time
- [ ] Create option for displaying directories in tree format
- [ ] Add some menus
- [ ] Add log service
- [ ] Periodic and automatic cleaning (?)

<a name="known-bugs"></a>

# :bug: Known bugs :bug:

- Sometimes, CLI is blocked while folder is deleting.
- Some terminals that do not use TTY (like git bash in windows) do not work.
- Sorting, especially by routes, can slow down the terminal when there are many results at the same time.
- Sometimes, size calculations are higher than they should be.
- (SOLVED) Performance issues when searching from high level directories (like / in linux).
- (SOLVED) Sometimes text collapses when updating the cli.
- (SOLVED) Analyzing the size of the directories takes longer than it should.

We have developed npkill in our free time, because we are passionate about the programming sector.
Tomorrow we would like to dedicate ourselves to this, but first, we have a long way to go.

We will continue to do things anyway, but donations are one of the many ways to support what we do.
